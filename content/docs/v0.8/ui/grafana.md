title: Building Dashboards with Grafana
---

* Grafana is a dashboarding tool modeled after Kibana. It was originally built for Graphite, but has since been updated to support InfluxDB. We need a detailed guide here ([which you can write and submit a PR for](https://github.com/influxdb/influxdb.org)), but in the meantime you can head over to the [Grafana site](http://grafana.org).

* Robin Moffatt has written a guide on using InfluxDB with Grafana, including details of building out graphs with metrics, [here](http://www.rittmanmead.com/2015/02/obiee-monitoring-and-diagnostics-with-influxdb-and-grafana/)
