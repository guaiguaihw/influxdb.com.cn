title: Guides

The goal of guides is to walk you through some specific use case or implementation scenario. If there's something you've done recently that you think would make a good guide, [let us know on the mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/influxdb).

If we think it makes sense or if others on the list give it a thumbs up, then [fork this docs repo](https://github.com/influxdb/influxdb.org) and submit a PR. We'll highlight it in a blog post and give you the respect, love, and adoration that your contribution deserves.
