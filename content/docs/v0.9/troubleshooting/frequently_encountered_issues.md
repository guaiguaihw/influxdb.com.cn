# Querying data
## Getting unexpected results with `GROUP BY time()`
A query that includes a `GROUP BY time()` clause can yield unexpected results:

* InfluxDB returns a single aggregated value with the timestamp `'1970-01-01T00:00:00Z'` even though the data include more than one instance of the time interval specified in `time()`
* InfluxDB returns `ERR: too many points in the group by interval. maybe you forgot to specify a where time clause?` even though the query includes a `WHERE` time clause.

Those returns typically proceed from the combination of the following two features of InfluxDB:

* By default, InfluxDB uses epoch 0 (`1970-01-01T00:00:00Z`) as the lower bound and `now()` as the upper bound in queries. 
* A query that includes `GROUP BY time()` must cover fewer than 100,000 instances of the supplied time interval

If your `WHERE` time clause is simply `WHERE time < now()` InfluxDB queries the data back to epoch 0 - that behavior often causes the query to breach the 100,000 instances rule and InfluxDB returns a confusing error or result. Avoid perplexing `GROUP BY time()` returns by specifying a valid time interval in the `WHERE` clause.

<dt> [GitHub Issue #2702](https://github.com/influxdb/influxdb/issues/2702)  and [GitHub Issue #4004](https://github.com/influxdb/influxdb/issues/4004)
</dt>

## Querying after `now()`
By default, InfluxDB uses `now()` (the current nanosecond timestamp of the node that is processing the query) as the upper bound in queries. You must provide explicit directions in the `WHERE` clause to query points that occur after `now()`. 

The first query below asks InfluxDB to return everything from `hillvalley` that occurs between epoch 0 (`1970-01-01T00:00:00Z`) and `now()`. The second query asks InfluxDB to return everything from `hillvalley` that occurs between epoch 0 and 1,000 days from `now()`.

`SELECT * FROM hillvalley`  
`SELECT * FROM hillvalley WHERE time < now() + 1000d`

## Querying outside the min/max time range 
Queries with a time range that exceeds the minimum or maximum timestamps valid for InfluxDB currently return no results, rather than an error message.

Smallest valid timestamp: `-9023372036854775808` (approximately `1684-01-22T14:50:02Z`)  
Largest valid timestamp: `9023372036854775807` (approximately `2255-12-09T23:13:56Z`)

<dt> [GitHub Issue #3369](https://github.com/influxdb/influxdb/issues/3369)  </dt>

## Querying a time range that spans epoch 0
Currently, InfluxDB can return results for queries that cover either the time range before epoch 0 or the time range after epoch 0, not both. A query with a time range that spans epoch 0 returns partial results.

> **Note:** InfluxDB has supported negative timestamps (timestamps that occur before epoch 0) in the past, but users should be aware of a bug when attempting to [write data with negative timestamps](../troubleshooting/frequently_encountered_issues.html#writing-data-with-negative-timestamps).

<dt> [GitHub Issue #2703](https://github.com/influxdb/influxdb/issues/2703)  </dt>

## Querying with booleans
Acceptable boolean syntax differs for data writes and data queries.

| Boolean syntax |  Writes | Queries  |
-----------------------|-----------|--------------|
|  `t`,`f` |	✔️ | ❌ |
|  `T`,`F` |  ✔️ |  ❌ |
|  `true`,`false` | ✔️  | ✔️  |
|  `True`,`False` |  ✔️ |  ✔️ |
|  `TRUE`,`FALSE` |  ✔️ |  ✔️ |

For example, `SELECT * FROM hamlet WHERE bool=True` returns all points with `bool` set to `TRUE`, but `SELECT * FROM hamlet WHERE bool=T` returns all points with`bool` set to `false`. 

<dt> [GitHub Issue #3939](https://github.com/influxdb/influxdb/issues/3939) </dt>

## Working with really big or really small integers
InfluxDB stores all integers as signed int64 data types. The minimum and maximum valid values for int64 are `-9023372036854775808` and `9023372036854775807`. See [Go builtins](http://golang.org/pkg/builtin/#int64) for more information. 

Values close to but within those limits may lead to unexpected results; some functions and operators convert the int64 data type to float64 during calculation which can cause overflow issues.

<dt> [GitHub Issue #3130](https://github.com/influxdb/influxdb/issues/3130)  </dt>

## Doing math on timestamps
Currently, it is not possible to execute mathematical operators or functions against timestamp values in InfluxDB. All time calculations must be carried out by the client receiving the query results.

## Getting an unexpected epoch 0 timestamp in query returns
In InfluxDB, epoch 0  (`1970-01-01T00:00:00Z`)  is often used as a null timestamp equivalent. If you request a query that has no timestamp to return, such as an aggregation function with an unbounded time range, InfluxDB returns epoch 0 as the timestamp. 

<dt> [GitHub Issue #3337](https://github.com/influxdb/influxdb/issues/3337) </dt>

## Getting large query returns in batches when using the HTTP API
InfluxDB returns large query results in batches of 10,000 points unless you use the query string parameter `chunk_size` to explicitly set the batch size.  For example, get results in batches of 20,000 points with:

`curl -G 'http://localhost:8086/query' --data-urlencode "db=deluge" --data-urlencode "chunk_size=20000" --data-urlencode "q=SELECT * FROM liters"`

<dt> See [GitHub Issue #3242](https://github.com/influxdb/influxdb/issues/3242) for more information on the challenges that this can cause, especially with Grafana visualization. </dt>

## Getting the `expected identifier` error, unexpectedly
Receiving the error `ERR: error parsing query: found [WORD], expected identifier[, string, number, bool]` is often a gentle reminder that you forgot to include something in your query, as is the case in the following examples:

* `SELECT FROM logic WHERE rational = 5` should be `SELECT something FROM logic WHERE rational = 5`  
* `SELECT * FROM WHERE rational = 5` should be `SELECT * FROM logic WHERE rational = 5`

In other cases, your query seems complete but you receive the same error:

* `SELECT field FROM why`  
* `SELECT * FROM why WHERE tag = '1'`  
* `SELECT * FROM grant WHERE why = 9`

In the last three queries, and in most unexpected `expected identifier` errors, at least one of the identifiers in the query is an InfluxQL keyword. Identifiers are database names, retention policy names, user names, measurement names, tag keys, and field keys. To successfully query data that use a keyword as an identifier enclose that identifier in double quotes, so the examples above become:

* `SELECT "field" FROM why`  
* `SELECT * FROM why WHERE "tag" = '1'`  
* `SELECT * FROM "grant" WHERE why = 9`

While using double quotes is an acceptable workaround, we recommend that you avoid using InfluxQL keywords as identifiers for simplicity's sake. The InfluxQL documentation has a comprehensive list of all [InfluxQL keywords](https://github.com/influxdb/influxdb/blob/master/influxql/INFLUXQL.md#keywords).

## Identifying write precision from returned timestamps
InfluxDB stores all timestamps as nanosecond values regardless of the write precision supplied. It is important to note that when returning query results, the database silently drops trailing zeros from timestamps which obscures the initial write precision. 

In the example below, the tags `precision_supplied` and `timestamp_supplied` show the time precision and timestamp that the user provided at the write. Because InfluxDB silently drops trailing zeros on returned timestamps, the write precision is not recognizable in the returned timestamps.  
<br>
```sh
name: trails
-------------
time                  value	 precision_supplied  timestamp_supplied
1970-01-01T01:00:00Z  3      n                   3600000000000
1970-01-01T01:00:00Z  5      h                   1
1970-01-01T02:00:00Z  4      n                   7200000000000
1970-01-01T02:00:00Z  6      h                   2
```

<dt> [GitHub Issue #2977](https://github.com/influxdb/influxdb/issues/2977) </dt>

## Single quoting and double quoting in queries
Single quote string values (for example, tag values) but do not single quote identifiers (database names, retention policy names, user names, measurement names, tag keys, and field keys). 

Double quote identifiers if they start with a digit, contain characters other than `[A-z,0-9,_]`, or if they are an [InfluxQL keyword](https://github.com/influxdb/influxdb/blob/master/influxql/INFLUXQL.md#keywords). You can double quote identifiers even if they don't fall into one of those categories but it isn't necessary.

Yes: `SELECT bikes_available FROM bikes WHERE station_id='9'`

Yes: `SELECT "bikes_available" FROM "bikes" WHERE "station_id"='9'`

Yes: `SELECT * from "cr@zy" where "p^e"='2'`

No: `SELECT 'bikes_available' FROM 'bikes' WHERE 'station_id'="9"`

No: `SELECT * from cr@zy where p^e='2'`

See the [Query Syntax](../query_language/query_syntax.html) page for more information.

## Writing more than one continuous query to a single series
Use a single continuous query to write several statistics to the same measurement and tag set. For example, tell InfluxDB to write to the `aggregated_stats` measurement the `MEAN` and `MIN` of the `value` field grouped by five-minute intervals and grouped by the `cpu` tag with:

`CREATE CONTINUOUS QUERY mean_min_value ON telegraf BEGIN SELECT MEAN(value) AS mean, MIN(value) AS min INTO aggregated_stats FROM cpu_idle GROUP BY time(5m),cpu END` 

If you create two separate continuous queries (one for calculating the `MEAN` and one for calculating the `MIN`), the `aggregated_stats` measurement will appear to be missing data. Separate continuous queries run at slightly different times and InfluxDB defines a unique point by its measurement, tag set, and timestamp (notice that field is missing from that list). So if two continuous queries write to different fields but also write to the same measurement and tag set, only one of the two fields will ever have data; the last continuous query to run will overwrite the results that were written by the first continuous query with the same timestamp.

For more on continuous queries, see the [continuous queries page](../query_language/continuous_queries.html).

# Writing data
## Writing integers
Add a trailing `i` to the end of the field value when writing an integer. If you do not provide the `i`, InfluxDB will treat the field value as a float. 

Writes an integer: `value=100i`  
Writes a float: `value=100` 

> **Note:** This syntax for writing integers is for versions 0.9.3+. Versions prior to 0.9.3 had a different syntax, see [PR #3526](https://github.com/influxdb/influxdb/pull/3526).

## Writing data with negative timestamps
InfluxDB has supported negative UNIX timestamps in the past, but there is currently a bug in the line protocol parser that treats negative timestamps as invalid syntax. For example, `INSERT waybackwhen past=1 -1` returns `ERR: unable to parse 'waybackwhen past=1 -1': bad timestamp`.

<dt> [GitHub Issue #3367](https://github.com/influxdb/influxdb/issues/3367) </dt>

## Getting an unexpected error when sending data over the HTTP API
First, double check your [line protocol](../write_protocols/line.html) syntax. Second, if you continue to receive errors along the lines of `bad timestamp` or `unable to parse`, verify that your newline character is line feed (`\n`, which is ASCII `0x0A`). InfluxDB's line protocol relies on `\n` to indicate the end of a line and the beginning of a new line; files or data that use a newline character other than `\n` will encounter parsing issues. Convert the newline character and try sending the data again.

> **Note:** If you generated your data file on a Windows machine, Windows uses carriage return and line feed (`\r\n`) as the newline character. 

## Words and characters to avoid
If you use any of the [InfluxQL keywords](https://github.com/influxdb/influxdb/blob/master/influxql/INFLUXQL.md#keywords) as an identifier you will need to double quote that identifier in every query. This can lead to [non-intuitive errors](../troubleshooting/frequently_encountered_issues.html#getting-the-expected-identifier-error-unexpectedly). Identifiers are database names, retention policy names, user names, measurement names, tag keys, and field keys. 

To keep regular expressions and quoting simple, avoid using the following characters in identifiers:  

`\` backslash   
 `^` circumflex accent  
 `$` dollar sign  
 `'` single quotation mark  
 `"` double quotation mark  
 `,` comma

## Single quoting and double quoting when writing data
* Avoid single quoting and double quoting identifiers when writing data via the line protocol; see the examples below for how writing identifiers with quotes can complicate queries. Identifiers are database names, retention policy names, user names, measurement names, tag keys, and field keys. 
<br>
<br>
	Write with a double-quoted measurement: `INSERT "bikes" bikes_available=3`  
	Applicable query: `SELECT * FROM "\"bikes\""`
<br>
<br>
	Write with a single-quoted measurement: `INSERT 'bikes' bikes_available=3`  
	Applicable query: `SELECT * FROM "\'bikes\'"`
<br>
<br>
	Write with an unquoted measurement: `INSERT bikes bikes_available=3`  
	Applicable query: `SELECT * FROM bikes`
<br>
<br>
* Double quote field values that are strings.
<br>
<br>
	Write: `INSERT bikes happiness="level 2"`  
	Applicable query: `SELECT * FROM bikes WHERE happiness='level 2'`
<br>
<br>
* Special characters should be escaped with a backslash and not placed in quotes. 
<br>
<br>
	Write: `INSERT wacky va\"ue=4`  
	Applicable query: `SELECT "va\"ue" FROM wacky`
	
See the [Line Protocol Syntax](https://influxdb.com/docs/v0.9/write_protocols/write_syntax.html) page for more information.

# Administration
## Single quoting the password string 
The `CREATE USER <user> WITH PASSWORD '<password>'` query requires single quotation marks around the password string. Do not include the single quotes when authenticating requests.

## Escaping the single quote in a password
For passwords that include a single quote, escape the single quote with a backslash both when creating the password and when authenticating requests.

## Identifying your version of InfluxDB
There a number of ways to identify the version of InfluxDB that you're using:

* Check the return when you `curl` the `/ping` endpoint. For example, if you're using 0.9.3 `curl -i 'http://localhost:8086/ping'` returns:  

`HTTP/1.1 204 No Content`  
`Request-Id: b7d7e0d6-5339-11e5-80bb-000000000000`  
✨`X-Influxdb-Version: 0.9.3`✨
`Date: Fri, 04 Sep 2015 19:18:26 GMT`

* Check the text that appears when you [launch](../introduction/getting_started.html#logging-in-and-creating-your-first-database) the CLI:

`Connected to http://localhost:8086` ✨`version 0.9.3`✨   
`InfluxDB shell 0.9.3`

* Check the HTTP response in your logs:  

`[http] 2015/09/04 12:29:07 ::1 - - [04/Sep/2015:12:29:06 -0700] GET /query?db=&q=create+database+there_you_go HTTP/1.1 200 40 -` ✨`InfluxDBShell/0.9.3`✨ `357970a0-533b-11e5-8001-000000000000 6.07408ms`
