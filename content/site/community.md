# Community

InfluxDB is an open-source company, so we rely on a strong community for feedback and adoption. We try to stay connected in as many ways as possible:

## Meetups & User Groups

Here's a list of local groups we know about:

- [SF InfluxDB User Group](http://www.meetup.com/San-Francisco-InfluxDB-Meetup/)
- [NYC InfluxDB User Group](http://www.meetup.com/NYC-InfluxDB-User-Group/)
- [Berlin InfluxDB Users](http://www.meetup.com/Berlin-InfluxDB-Users/)

If you're interested in starting your own meetup, email us at [contact@influxdb.com](mailto:contact@influxdb.com) and we'll cover the Meetup dues for you!

## In Person

If you're in New York City or San Francisco we're up for meeting up and hacking or answering questions almost any time day or night.

## Support

We're available for professional services and support. We can help you build out a custom solution on top of InfluxDB or help you get set up to make the most of InfluxDB. Drop us a line at [support@influxdb.com](mailto:support@influxdb.com).

## Presenting

We're up for giving talks at local user groups, meetups, and conferences any time. We can talk about InfluxDB, distributed computing, our experience building in Go, or scaling real-time analytics. If it's within train distance from NYC, we'd be happy to come to you almost any time. Otherwise, get in touch at [contact@influxdb.com](mailto:contact@influxdb.com) and tell us about your group and when you'd like us to drop by. If it requires a flight we'd like to make sure we can line up some other groups nearby around the same time.
