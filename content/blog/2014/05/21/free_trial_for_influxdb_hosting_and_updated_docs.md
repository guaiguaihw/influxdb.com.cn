Today we're announcing managed hosting of InfluxDB and [Grafana](http://grafana.org/) (the excellent open source dashboarding solution)! Plans start at just $39 per month for a single node and an extra $49 per month for each additional node. Each InfluxDB node has 10GB of storage and you can expand the cluster at any time as your needs grow. Get up and running in under a minute by signing up for a [30 day free trial of hosted InfluxDB here](https://customers.influxdb.com/).

If you're looking for help running InfluxDB on your own hardware, cloud, or behind the firewall, just a line at support@influxdb.com. We can set up and manage a cluster for you on your own servers and provide additional support.

We've also [updated the InfluxDB documentation](http://influxdb.org/docs/v0.6/introduction/getting_started.html). It's not quite complete, but the outline is there and we'll be filling it in over the next few weeks. Or if you're up for contributing to InfluxDB, but don't want to write Go, pick a section that hasn't been written yet and contribute to the docs!

We have tons of exciting work coming up and the community is growing very quickly. Let us know if you need any help or just drop us a line to tell us about your use case. If there are any features you need, we prioritize based on the number of people that ask for it, so don't hesitate to let us know.
